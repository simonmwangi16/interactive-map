Title: Interactive Map
Description: This is an interactive that that responds to clicks. Click on a particular area on the mpa (marked by green) to reveal the details of the area. I've used http://www.maschek.hu/imagemap/ which is an online map editor to create the HTML map of a model house. Feel free to fork this projects.
